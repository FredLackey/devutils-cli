## Status Key

- **Complete - has dependencies**: Analysis complete, technology requires one or more dependencies
- **Complete - none required**: Analysis complete, technology has no external dependencies
- **Skipped - already documented**: Technology already had a ## Dependencies section, no analysis needed
- **Failed - analysis error**: Agent encountered an error during analysis

## Failures

*No failures recorded.*

## Next Steps

- Review the Dependencies sections in each markdown file for accuracy
- Ensure all acquisition commands are correct for each platform
- Proceed with installation testing using the install-tester agent
