## Dependency Handling Behavior

This section documents how each installer handles its dependencies at runtime. Understanding this behavior helps users know what to expect when running `dev install <tool>`.

### Behavior Categories

| Category | Description | User Action Required |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Exits with Message** | Installation stops and displays instructions | User must install dependency first |
| **Auto-Installs Inline** | Prerequisites installed automatically | None - fully automatic |
| **Pre-installed/Bundled** | Dependency already present on system | None |

### Platform-Specific Patterns

#### macOS (Homebrew Required)

Most macOS installers require Homebrew. If Homebrew is not installed:
- Installation **exits gracefully** with a message
- User is instructed to run `dev install homebrew` first
- Installation does **NOT** proceed automatically

**Installers that exit if Homebrew is missing:**
- adobe-creative-cloud, appcleaner, atomicparsley, aws-cli, balena-etcher, bambu-studio
- bash, bash-completion, beyond-compare, brave-browser, caffeine, camtasia, chatgpt
- chrome-canary, chromium, cursor, dbschema, docker, drawio
- elmedia-player, ffmpeg, git, go, google-chrome, gpg, imageoptim
- jq, keyboard-maestro, latex, lftp, messenger, microsoft-office
- microsoft-teams, node, nordpass, nvm, openssh, pandoc, pinentry
- pngyu, postman, safari-tech-preview, sfnt2woff, shellcheck, slack
- snagit, spotify, studio-3t, sublime-text, superwhisper, tailscale
- termius, terraform, tidal, tmux, tree, vim, vlc, vscode, wget
- whatsapp, woff2, xcode, yarn, yq, yt-dlp, zoom

**Exception - Docker throws an error instead of returning:**
- docker.js throws an `Error` if Homebrew is missing (install fails with error)

#### Windows (Chocolatey Required)

Most Windows installers require Chocolatey. If Chocolatey is not installed:
- Installation **exits gracefully** with a message
- User is instructed to install Chocolatey (PowerShell command provided)
- Installation does **NOT** proceed automatically

**Installers that exit if Chocolatey is missing:**
- atomicparsley, aws-cli, balena-etcher, bambu-studio, beyond-compare, brave-browser
- camtasia, chrome-canary, chromium, curl, cursor, dbschema, docker
- drawio, ffmpeg, git, go, google-chrome, gpg, jq, latex, lftp
- messenger, microsoft-office, microsoft-teams, node, nordpass, nvm
- openssh, pandoc, pinentry, postman, shellcheck, slack, snagit
- spotify, studio-3t, sublime-text, tailscale, termius, terraform
- tidal, tmux, tree, vim, vlc, vscode, wget, whatsapp, yarn, yq
- yt-dlp, zoom

**Exception - Docker throws an error instead of returning:**
- docker.js throws an `Error` if Chocolatey is missing (install fails with error)

#### Git Bash (Mixed Behavior)

Git Bash installers have varying behavior:

**Pre-installed/Bundled (no action needed):**
- curl - bundled with Git for Windows
- git - bundled with Git for Windows (Git Bash IS Git)

**Uses Chocolatey via PowerShell:**
- docker, node, nvm, terraform, vscode, yarn - call `powershell.exe` to run Chocolatey
- If Chocolatey is not installed, installation exits with instructions

**Not Supported:**
- homebrew - not available for Git Bash (advises WSL)

#### Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian (Auto-Install Prerequisites)

Linux installers using APT typically **auto-install prerequisites inline**. The user does not need to install dependencies first.

**Examples of auto-installed prerequisites:**
- docker.js: Installs `ca-certificates`, `curl` automatically
- node.js: Installs `curl`, `ca-certificates`, `gnupg` automatically
- vscode.js: Installs `wget`, `gpg`, `apt-transport-https` automatically
- terraform.js: Installs `gnupg`, `software-properties-common`, `wget` automatically
- homebrew.js: Installs `build-essential`, `procps`, `curl`, `file`, `git` automatically

**Simple APT installers (no special prerequisites):**
- curl, git, vim, tree, tmux, jq, wget, gpg, openssh, pandoc, shellcheck

#### Amazon Linux (Auto-Install Prerequisites)

Amazon Linux installers using DNF/YUM typically **auto-install prerequisites inline**.

**Examples of auto-installed prerequisites:**
- terraform.js: Installs `yum-utils` automatically
- homebrew.js: Installs `Development Tools` group, `procps-ng`, `curl`, `file`, `git` automatically

**Simple DNF/YUM installers (no special prerequisites):**
- curl, git, vim, tree, tmux, jq, wget, gpg

#### WSL (Ubuntu Behavior)

WSL installers follow the same behavior as Ubuntu:
- Prerequisites are **auto-installed inline**
- No manual dependency installation required

### Summary Table by Installer

| Installer | macOS | Windows | Git Bash | Ubuntu/Debian | Amazon Linux |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| curl | Exits (Homebrew) | Exits (Choco) | Bundled | Auto-install | Auto-install |
| docker | **Throws** (Homebrew) | **Throws** (Choco) | PowerShell | Auto-install | Auto-install |
| git | Exits (Homebrew) | Exits (Choco) | Bundled | Auto-install | Auto-install |
| homebrew | N/A (is the dep) | Not supported | Not supported | Auto-install | Auto-install |
| node | Exits (Homebrew) | Exits (Choco) | PowerShell | Auto-install | Auto-install |
| terraform | Exits (Homebrew) | Exits (Choco) | PowerShell | Auto-install | Auto-install |
| vscode | Exits (Homebrew) | Exits (Choco) | PowerShell | Auto-install | Auto-install |

### Key Takeaways

1. **macOS/Windows users**: Must install package manager (Homebrew/Chocolatey) first
2. **Linux users**: Dependencies are handled automatically - just run `dev install <tool>`
3. **Git Bash users**: Some tools bundled, others require Chocolatey on Windows host
4. **Most installers exit gracefully** with helpful messages rather than throwing errors
5. **docker.js is an exception** - it throws an error if package manager is missing
