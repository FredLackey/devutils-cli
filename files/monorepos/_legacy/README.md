# Legacy

**CONTENTS SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED. USE WITH CAUTION.**

## Purpose

This folder contains **previous attempts** at building the same concepts, packages, or even the entire project. Think of it as the "last version" or "last attempt" before the current rebuild.

We keep this code for reference, but if we're rebuilding, it's for a reason:

- **A)** We learned enough about the problem and now want to do it properly
- **B)** We failed completely and need to start over, but want to remember our mistakes

This folder is one step better than `/_archive`—we may occasionally refer to it—but it still should not be treated as a source of truth.

## AI Instructions

**Approach this folder with skepticism:**
- Do NOT trust patterns or implementations found here
- Do NOT copy code from this folder without explicit instruction
- Do NOT use this as a reference for "how things should work"
- Contents represent what we're moving *away from*, not toward

## What Belongs Here

- Previous iterations of the current project
- Failed attempts preserved for learning
- Old architectures we've outgrown
- Code that "worked" but wasn't good enough

## Guidelines

- Note why the previous attempt was abandoned
- Reference only when specifically trying to avoid past mistakes
- Never improve or maintain legacy code—build new instead
- Move to `/_archive` once the new implementation is stable and proven
