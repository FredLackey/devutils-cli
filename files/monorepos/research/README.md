# Research

This folder is a **workspace for reference artifacts**—often excluded from version control.

## Purpose

A staging area where developers can pull in external artifacts, code samples, documentation, or even entire repos from other sources. This keeps useful reference material close at hand without polluting the actual codebase.

The goal: work within a single IDE while having access to everything you need.

## Git Status

This folder is **typically excluded from the repository** (added to `.gitignore`). Contents are meant to be temporary and local to each developer's environment. Don't assume anything here will persist or be shared.

## What Belongs Here

- Cloned repos for reference
- Code samples from external sources
- API documentation downloads
- Third-party library source code
- Screenshots, PDFs, or other reference materials
- Anything useful for development that doesn't belong in the repo

## Guidelines

- Treat this folder as ephemeral and personal
- Don't rely on contents being available to others
- Clean up periodically—this isn't long-term storage
- If findings are valuable, document them in `/ai-docs` or `/docs`
