# AI Docs

This folder contains documentation **created by AI, for AI**.

## Purpose

A persistent knowledge base that preserves AI research, discoveries, and insights so they don't have to be repeated. When AI investigates a concept, researches a technique, or works through a problem, the findings are documented here for future reference.

This eliminates redundant research and discovery processes across sessions.

## Usage

- AI writes documentation here after research or discovery work
- AI reads from this folder to recall prior findings
- Humans may reference content but it's optimized for AI consumption
- Treat as a "memory" that persists between AI sessions

## What Belongs Here

- Research findings and conclusions
- Technology evaluations and comparisons
- Best practices and implementation patterns
- Convention documentation and standards
- Schema definitions
- Brainstorming outcomes and design decisions
- Concept explanations and technical deep-dives

## Guidelines

- Write in clear, structured formats AI can easily parse
- Include context about why research was performed
- Update documents as understanding evolves
- Prefer comprehensive detail over brevity
