# Docs

This folder contains documentation **created by humans, for humans**.

## Purpose

The counterpart to `/ai-docs`—this folder holds documentation intended for human authors and human readers. Content here should be accessible, verbose enough for clarity, and written so that a junior developer or project manager can understand it.

AI may assist with editing, formatting, or refining language, but the content is fundamentally human-focused.

## Audience

- Junior developers onboarding to the project
- Project managers needing business context
- Team members referencing technical decisions
- External contributors or stakeholders

## What Belongs Here

- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Setup and installation guides
- API documentation and usage examples
- Business logic explanations
- Deployment and operations guides
- Contributing guidelines
- Project overviews and roadmaps

## Guidelines

- Write for clarity over brevity
- Assume the reader may not have full context
- Explain the "why" alongside the "what"
- Use plain language; avoid unnecessary jargon
- Include examples where helpful

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- AI-generated research or discovery docs (use `/ai-docs`)
- Exploratory research materials (use `/research`)
- Auto-generated API docs (keep with the relevant app)
